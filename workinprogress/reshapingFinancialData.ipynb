    "# Understanding tick data\n",
    "# Tick data represents the most granular level of data available. It records every single transaction that occurs in a market. This is the most accurate data available, but it is also the most expensive. Tick data is typically only available for a few days or weeks at a time. It is also very difficult to store and analyze. For these reasons, tick data is typically only used by professional traders and hedge funds."
