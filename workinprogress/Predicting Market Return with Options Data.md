# What this paper is about?
- Options are a conduit of carrying information into the market, which subsequently leads to stock
price changes Grossman (1988).
-  Both options volume and open interest have been used in addition to other factors in modeling early warning system for market crisis Li et al. (2015).

Open Interest: Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts in a particular market or security that have not yet been settled or closed. In the options market, open interest refers to the total number of options contracts that are currently outstanding and have not yet been exercised or expired. An increase in open interest usually indicates that new money is flowing into the market, as more contracts are being bought or sold. On the other hand, a decrease in open interest can indicate that traders are closing their positions or that there is a lack of interest in the market. Open interest can be used as a measure of market activity, as well as a way to gauge the sentiment of market participants. It is important to note, however, that open interest is not the same as trading volume. Trading volume refers to the number of contracts that are traded during a particular time period, while open interest reflects the total number of contracts that are outstanding at a specific point in time.

PCR: In the options market, the Put Call Ratio (PCR) is a technical indicator that shows the relationship between the number of put options and call options that are traded in a particular market or security. The PCR is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options that are traded over a specific time period, usually a day or a week. The PCR can be used as a way to gauge market sentiment, as well as a way to identify potential reversal points in the market. A high PCR indicates that there are more put options being traded relative to call options, which may be seen as a bearish sign. On the other hand, a low PCR indicates that there are more call options being traded relative to put options, which may be seen as a bullish sign.

PCR (OI) = open interest of put options on a given day/open interest of call options on the same
given day
PCR (VOL) = volume of put options on a given day/volume of call options on the same given daygh
