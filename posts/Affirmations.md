### FOCUS ON FASTER ITERATION AND NOT ON ACCURACY
 - It's important to do things fast.  
 - A week is 2% of the year. 
 - Time is the denominator. 
 - You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently.
 - Optimize for being spectacularly right some of the time, and low-stakes wrong a lot of the time. 
 - The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension. 
 - The downsides are worth it. 

### GO TOUCH THE METAL
- Hard skills are super important. 
- Get good with your tools. I mean, really good. 
- Get rid of all the friction. Keep oiling your tools and don't let them rust. 
- Don't get lost in the busy bandwagon of managerial or bureaucratic duties. Those create empty suits.

### GET GOOD AT SMALL TALK
- Soft skills are even more important. 
- Sapiens are emotional species. They cannot think objectively. 
- Get good at telling stories. Get good at sales.
- Listen at least thrice more than you speak.
- Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
- If right things are said in a wrong way, they lose their righteousness.
- And yes! when deep into shit, keep your mouth shut.

### INSPIRATION IS PERISHABLE. ACT ON IT.
- Start before you are ready
- Thousands have the same idea, which you think is original and exclusive to you. 
- Thinking is easy, doing is hard! Only execution matters. Ship it!

### LIFE ISN'T UNFAIR, IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY UNFAIR. 
- The path isn't linear. It is a Geometric Brownian motion with a drift. Make sure that the trend coefficient is always positive. 
- There are people who are way more smarter and hardworking than you are, but are not sitting on the priviliges that you have. And vice verca.
- Efficient Market Hypothesis is a flawed heuristic.

### WE ARE MONKEYS. WE COPY.
- You will always feel an overpowering urge to fit in and follow the herd. It's natural! It is the evolutionary make-up of your brain that you inherited from your primordial ancestors.  
- The best thing you can do is that make sure that the herd around you is smarter and more aware than you are. 

### HAVE SELF BELIEF TO THE POINT OF DELUSION
- You can do more than you think
- You are tied down by your own invisible orthodoxy. The laws of physics are the only limit
- And do not get trapped at local maxima. 

### RAISE THE CEILING, AND NEVER THE FLOOR
- And yes, most important! Ego is the enemy. It is self defeating and depression inducing. 
- Always be grounded. 
- The higher you go, the harder it will get to contain your ego. 
- Never forget, you are a mere mortal chimp with a plan and also without a tail.

I love ya!
