1) The p-value is uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis.

2) You can't accept the Null Hypothesis.

3) In nature, Normal Distribution is not the most prevalent.

4) There is a difference between Normal Distribution and Standard Normal Distribution.

5) The earliest use of Logistic Regression was not for classification but regression. Logistic Regression outputs probabilities not just 0 and 1.

6) The confusion matrix is not named because it causes confusion.

7) Non Parametric does not mean No Parameters.

8) Central limit theorem does not kick in at n=30.

9) Confidence Interval will be always narrower than Prediction Interval.

10) Log transformation will make your data near "Normal" only if your original data distribution was Log Normal.

11) F test in Linear Regression is not useful.

12) The standard error is the estimate of SD.

13) Errors != Residuals.

14) Maximizing the Likelihood is equivalent to minimizing KL Divergence.

15) AUROC is all about ranking and has an interesting relation with Mann Whitney U test.

16) PDF != Probability.
